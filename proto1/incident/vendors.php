                <p>
                    The Forest Service AQM staff is working hard to standardize the procurement process across all regions and encourage open competition for all who participate. Efforts include a <a href="compsolplan.php">National Solicitation Plan for I-BPAs</a> which specifies when each type of equipment or service is scheduled to be competed with national standard specifications and a consistent process for <a href="compsolplan.php">Contractor Performance Evaluations</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We continue to explore new technology and other system enhancements to ensure VIPR is an efficient, effective tool. You can keep up with our progress by visiting the <a href="vipr.php">Virtual Incident Procurement (VIPR)</a> project.

                    <dd>
                        <p>In order to do business with the Government, vendors MUST have an active SAM account. For vendors who use VIPR, they MUST ensure certain company information they provide in VIPR matches the same type of information that is found in their SAM record. VIPR and SAM share the following vendor company information:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>DUNS</li>
                            <li>Company Name</li>
                            <li>Company DBA</li>
                            <li>Company Address</li>
                            <li>Mailing Address</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Ensuring the above information matches in both systems is critical in order for payments to be made to vendors.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To assist vendors with keeping their company information in sync across both systems, VIPR now has an interconnection with SAM. VIPR will do validation checks against SAM data throughout various phases in the procurement process:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>When a vendor registers in the VIPR vendor application, VIPR will display the company name and DBA from SAM so the vendor can verify they entered the DUNS correctly. </li>
                            <li>A vendor will be able to submit quotes to VIPR solicitations; however, if their SAM record is expired or their company information in VIPR does not match what is in SAM, then the vendor will be ineligible to receive awards by Contracting Officers.</li>
                            <li>If a vendor has changed their company information in SAM and they have not updated that company information in VIPR to reflect those changes, then the vendor will be unable to respond to modifications to their agreement until they import their updated company information from SAM into VIPR. (The vendor application provides vendors with an "Import from SAM" function.)</li>
                            <li>If a vendor's SAM record has expired since receiving their award, then the vendor will be unable to respond to modifications to their agreement until they get their SAM record re-activated. </li>
                        </ul>

                            Contracting Officers may be issuing "generic" solicitations, which are designed to solicit for various local equipment and services not listed on the National Solicitation Plan for I-BPAs, but may be identified on the Method of Hire (MOH) chart located in the <a href="http://www.nwcg.gov/teams/ibpwt/documents/index.htm">Interagency Incident Business Management Handbook (IIBMH)</a>. Interagency Incident Business Management Handbook (IIBMH). An example of a generic solicitation might be "Short School Type Bus." Vendors can use the "Generic" resource group in the vendor application to add their resources that do not fall into any of the standard resource groups into the vendor application. Vendors will follow the same quote submittal process, but will use their generic resources to submit quotes on the "generic" solicitations.

                            The Virtual Incident Procurement (VIPR) system was successfully introduced to production in January of 2009. Forest Service regions use VIPR to issue solicitations and award agreements for resources secured under preseason agreements.  For information on the types of resources and the schedule the Forest Service follows to solicit, check out the <a href="compsolplan.php">National Solicitation Plan</a>.
