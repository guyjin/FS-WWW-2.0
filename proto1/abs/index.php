                      The <strong>Aviation Business System (ABS)</strong> is a web based application that
                      will be used by the USDA, Forest Service to electronically document and process all contract
                      aviation costs currently documented on FS-6500-122 Flight Use Invoice (invoice). 
                      A disconnected client, non-web limited component version, of the application is
                      available for remote use.  This new system will require that data will be entered
                      electronically into ABS from the source location (Helibase, Tanker Base, etc) by
                      aircraft managers or other designated persons.   From there the following workflow
                      will be followed:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        The appropriate Contracting Officer (CO) or designated Contracting Officer's
                        Representative (COR) will review and approve each invoice.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The CO or COR will electronically select approved invoices to be packaged for
                        payment and approve the package using a Personal Identification Number (PIN)
                        to indicate approval.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        After approval by the CO or COR, the vendor will receive notification that a
                        package is ready for approval.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        After successful review, and application of a PIN by the Vendor, the package
                        will be submitted to the Albuquerque Service Center (ASC) Incident Database
                        (IBDB) for final processing of the payment.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        If the vendor requests any changes to the payment package the changes will be
                        reviewed by the CO/COR, the changes accepted or rejected and notification of
                        the results sent to the vendor.  The package is then submitted directly
                        to the ASC IBDB for payment.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                              <p>
                      Access to the system will require an individual USDA eAuthentication account and password
                      for all users.  In addition, a secure PIN number will be provided to Contracting
                      Officers (COs) and Contracting Officer Representatives (CORs).  Contractors will be
                      issued a PIN number by the CO who administers their contracts.  The pin will be
                      required for electronic approval of payment packages.  In addition each user must
                      register in ABS the first time they log on.  Please read the step by step
                      instructions under "Getting Started".
